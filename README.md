# Tomb Raider Automated Fix
Automated installer to upgrade your Steam or GOG copy of Tomb Raider I to the definite modern version of the game.

## Install
* Make sure you have a clean install of the Steam/GOG version first.
* [Get the latest version](https://github.com/Carlmundo/TombRaider-AutomatedFix/releases/tag/release)  - click "Download Tomb Raider Automated Fix"
* Run the file to install.
* Once complete, launch the game on Steam and select "Tomb Raider I" or "Unfinished Business" from the launcher.

If the launcher won't open and your PC is severely outdated, then you need [.NET Framework 4.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=17718).

## About
This tool is ideal for those looking for an easy automated patch to play Tomb Raider in it's best possible state.

Provides significant enhancements to the game:
* Custom launcher to play the base game and Unfinished Business expansion
* Unlocked resolution (runs in native resolution by default)
* Improved graphics
* Full soundtrack
* Water color from the PlayStation version
* Steam overlay support
* No longer plays with DOSBox
* Optional higher resolution or remastered cutscenes

Normally, this can be achieved by manually installing and configuring the Tomb Raider Retail Fix but that requires a lot of tinkering that many people have had trouble with. The tweaks are already made for you and the modded game can now be launched from Steam (unlike with a manual install).

## Advanced Configuration (optional)
In the game folder, open the Patches folder and edit the correct file to manage additional settings:

* **tombati** - Tomb Raider
* **tombub** - Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business
